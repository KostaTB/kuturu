## Kuturu

Dataset consisting of a piece in Albanian, tailored for benchmarking spelling corrector algorithms.
Alongside the original writing, the dataset also contains the same text but with instrumented grammatical errors.

### Getting Started

The original text contains 9 paragraphs. Such a number is low enough to also allow slow algorithms
to still get a chance to take part in the benchmarking, but also high enough to provide some sort of meaningful insight.
The original writing is located in [**original_kuturu.txt**](original_kuturu.txt), while the one with errors is located in
[**faulty_kuturu.txt**](faulty_kuturu.txt). The number of errors added is 39.

The typologies of mistakes fall under one of the following categories:
The mistakes tend to be more lexical, but the most prominent one would be the lack of letter "ë".
Another type of mistakes would be dialectisms, such as "shoqnia", followed by the use of words that appear to be standardized like "kartopecetë" and loanwords, written in erraneous way: kamarier.
